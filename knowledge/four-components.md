# The Four Components of NVC

NVC structures communication around four components. They can be used when speaking (honest expression) or when listening (empathic reception). The components are not a rigid script — they are a lens for awareness.

## 1. Observation

**What happened, described without evaluation or interpretation.**

An observation is a concrete, specific description of what was seen, heard, or otherwise perceived — as if recorded by a camera. It is free of judgment, assumption, or generalization.

### Key principle
Separate what you *observed* from what you *think about* what you observed.

### Examples
| Evaluation (not an observation) | Observation |
|---|---|
| "You're always late." | "You arrived 20 minutes after we agreed to meet, three times this week." |
| "She's manipulative." | "She told me one thing and told my colleague something different." |
| "This code is a mess." | "I had difficulty understanding the structure of this file after 15 minutes of reading." |

### Common pitfalls
- **Generalizations**: "always", "never", "everyone", "nobody"
- **Evaluative language**: "bad", "lazy", "irresponsible", "great", "good"
- **Interpretations of motive**: "He did it on purpose", "She doesn't care"
- **Diagnoses**: "You're being passive-aggressive"

## 2. Feeling

**What emotion arises in me in connection with the observation.**

A feeling is an emotional state — not a thought, judgment, or interpretation. NVC distinguishes genuine feelings from what Rosenberg calls "faux feelings" — words that describe what we *think* others are doing to us rather than what we feel.

### Key principle
Own your feelings. They arise from your needs, not from what others do. Others may be a stimulus, but they are not the cause.

### Examples
| Faux feeling (judgment disguised as feeling) | Genuine feeling |
|---|---|
| "I feel manipulated." | "I feel confused and uneasy." |
| "I feel ignored." | "I feel lonely and sad." |
| "I feel like you don't care." | "I feel worried and disconnected." |
| "I feel that this is unfair." | "I feel frustrated and discouraged." |

### Genuine feelings when needs are met
Joyful, grateful, relieved, moved, inspired, calm, hopeful, enthusiastic, content, touched, peaceful, energized, satisfied, tender, confident.

### Genuine feelings when needs are unmet
Sad, frustrated, anxious, angry, scared, confused, helpless, exhausted, lonely, overwhelmed, irritated, disappointed, embarrassed, restless, heavy-hearted.

## 3. Need

**The universal human need that underlies the feeling.**

Needs in NVC are universal — every person has them, regardless of culture, age, or background. They are not strategies (e.g., "I need you to call me") but deep human values and requirements for wellbeing (e.g., "I need connection and reassurance").

### Key principle
Needs are not attached to a specific person, action, or object. When you identify the need, you open space for many possible strategies to meet it.

### Categories of needs
- **Connection**: belonging, closeness, empathy, love, support, understanding, community
- **Autonomy**: choice, freedom, independence, self-expression, space
- **Meaning**: contribution, creativity, growth, learning, purpose, clarity
- **Safety**: consistency, order, predictability, trust, protection
- **Physical wellbeing**: food, rest, movement, shelter, health, touch
- **Play**: humor, lightness, joy, spontaneity
- **Honesty**: authenticity, integrity, presence, transparency
- **Peace**: harmony, beauty, ease, equanimity

*(See `catalogs/needs.yaml` for the full structured list.)*

### Common confusion: needs vs. strategies
| Strategy (not a universal need) | Underlying need |
|---|---|
| "I need you to apologize." | I need acknowledgment and respect. |
| "I need this task done by Friday." | I need reliability and order. |
| "I need to be left alone." | I need space and autonomy. |

## 4. Request

**A concrete, positive, doable action I ask of myself or another — right now.**

A request is what you ask for to help meet the need. It differs from a demand in that the person asked has a genuine choice to say no, and refusal is met with curiosity rather than punishment.

### Key principles
- **Concrete and specific**: Not "be more supportive" but "Would you be willing to listen to me for 10 minutes without offering advice?"
- **Positive**: Ask for what you *want*, not what you *don't* want.
- **Present-focused**: What would help right now, in this interaction?
- **Negotiable**: A request becomes a demand when "no" is not accepted.

### Two types of requests

**Connection requests** — Check mutual understanding or presence:
- "Would you be willing to tell me what you heard me say?"
- "How are you feeling about what I just shared?"

**Action requests** — Ask for a specific action:
- "Would you be willing to meet at 10:00 instead of 9:00 tomorrow?"
- "Would you send me a message when you've read this?"

### Distinguishing request from demand
A request grants the other person full freedom to say no. If they say no, you respond with empathy and curiosity ("What makes that difficult for you?"), not with blame, guilt, or withdrawal.

## Putting the Four Components Together

A full NVC expression might sound like:

> "When I see the dishes left in the sink in the morning *(observation)*, I feel overwhelmed and a bit resentful *(feeling)*, because I need shared responsibility for our living space *(need)*. Would you be willing to wash your dishes before going to bed? *(request)*"

In practice, NVC is rarely this formulaic. The four components are a map for inner awareness, not a sentence template.
