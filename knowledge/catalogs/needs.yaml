# NVC Needs Catalog
# Based on Marshall Rosenberg's NVC framework.
#
# Needs in NVC are UNIVERSAL — shared by all humans regardless of culture,
# age, or background. They are not attached to a specific person, action,
# or object. A need is never "I need YOU to..." — that is a strategy.
#
# Distinguishing needs from strategies opens space for creative, mutually
# satisfying solutions. See four-components.md and principles.md.
