# NVC Feelings Catalog
# Based on Marshall Rosenberg's NVC framework.
#
# IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
# Rosenberg identified two categories of feelings:
#
# 1. FUNDAMENTAL FEELINGS — directly signal whether a need is met or unmet.
#    These are the feelings NVC aims to surface and express.
#
# 2. MASKING FEELINGS — surface emotions that contain a hidden judgment or
#    interpretation of another's behavior. Anger is the primary example.
#    Rosenberg: "Anger is caused by thinking." Beneath anger is always a
#    more vulnerable fundamental feeling (hurt, scared, sad, powerless).
#    Masking feelings are valid signals, but they point *toward* a judgment
#    that needs to be translated — not expressed as the final feeling.
#
# Words like "manipulated", "ignored", "abandoned", "betrayed" are NOT feelings
# at all in NVC — they describe what we think others did to us. See principles.md.

# MASKING FEELINGS
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# These are commonly experienced and named as feelings, but in NVC they are
# understood as signals that a judgment is active. They serve as an entry point:
# when you notice one, ask — "What am I telling myself? What fundamental feeling
# and unmet need lies beneath this?"
#
# Anger is the central example. Rosenberg: "I have yet to find an instance of
# anger that did not have a judgment at its root."

masking:

  anger_family:
    description: >
      Anger contains a judgment that someone "should" or "shouldn't" have done something.
      Beneath it: hurt, scared, sad, powerless, or a combination.
      Process: Notice anger → find the judgment → identify the need → find the underlying feeling.
    feelings:
      - angry
      - furious
      - enraged
      - outraged
      - resentful
      - bitter
      - irritated
      - annoyed
      - indignant
      - hostile

  guilt_shame_family:
    description: >
      Guilt and shame involve self-directed judgment ("I should have / I shouldn't have").
      Beneath them: regret, sadness, fear, or longing — in response to an unmet need
      (for integrity, care, contribution, etc.).
    feelings:
      - guilty
      - ashamed
      - humiliated
      - self-critical
      - worthless

  note: >
    The distinction between fundamental and masking is not about suppressing the
    masking feeling — it is an invitation to go deeper. Expressing "I feel furious"
    is valid as a starting point; NVC encourages moving toward the more vulnerable
    layer underneath.
