# Nonviolent Communication — Overview

## What is NVC?

Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is a communication framework developed by Marshall B. Rosenberg in the 1960s and described in his book *Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life* (1999). It is also called **Compassionate Communication** or the **Language of Life**.

NVC is based on the assumption that all human beings share the same fundamental needs, and that conflict, aggression, and misunderstanding arise not from people being inherently selfish or bad, but from strategies people use to meet their needs — strategies that sometimes clash with those of others.

## Core Premise

Every action a person takes is an attempt to meet a need. When we understand what need is driving behavior — our own or another's — compassion and cooperation become possible.

NVC does not aim to "win" communication or change others. It aims to create honest, empathetic connection from which mutually satisfying outcomes can emerge naturally.

## Origin and Context

Marshall Rosenberg developed NVC while working as a mediator and psychologist in conflict situations — in schools, prisons, and eventually in international peace negotiations. He was influenced by Carl Rogers' person-centered therapy and Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence (*ahimsa*).

NVC has since been applied in:
- Personal relationships and families
- Workplaces and organizations
- Schools and education
- Mediation and conflict resolution
- Political negotiation and peacebuilding
- Therapeutic and counseling contexts

## The Purpose of NVC

NVC serves three interconnected purposes:

1. **Self-empathy** — Understanding one's own inner experience: what one observes, feels, and needs, without self-judgment.
2. **Honest expression** — Expressing oneself clearly and vulnerably in a way that invites connection rather than defense.
3. **Empathic listening** — Receiving another's message by attending to their observations, feelings, needs, and requests — regardless of the words they use.

## What NVC Is Not

- It is not a technique to manipulate others into agreeing with you.
- It is not about being "nice" or suppressing difficult emotions.
- It is not a rigid script or formula to follow word-by-word.
- It is not a tool to prove you are right.

NVC is a practice of consciousness — a way of paying attention that can transform communication even without specific words.
