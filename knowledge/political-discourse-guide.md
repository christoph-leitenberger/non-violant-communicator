# Political Discourse Guide

Instructions for analyzing real political citations through the NVC lens — surfacing life-alienating communication patterns and the human needs behind political rhetoric.

---

## Purpose

The goal is NOT to simulate a fictional debate or declare winners. The goal is to:

- **Analyze real political speech** — work with verbatim quotes, not invented positions.
- **Surface life-alienating patterns** — identify evaluations, judgments, demands, and other NVC anti-patterns in political language.
- **Excavate the human needs** behind political rhetoric — what universal needs is the speaker trying to meet?
- **Demonstrate NVC transformation** — show how the same political intent can be expressed without life-alienating language.
- **Build critical listening skills** — help the reader notice communication patterns in political discourse.

## Three-Phase Process

### Phase 1: Citation Display

Present each citation verbatim with clear source attribution. Do not alter, paraphrase, or editorialize. Format:

```
> "[exact quote]"
> — [source attribution]
```

If the user provided a topic, briefly note the context.

### Phase 2: NVC Clarification

For each citation, analyze the communication patterns — NOT the political position. Identify:

#### Life-Alienating Patterns

Scan for these specific patterns (from NVC principles):

1. **Moralistic judgments** — labeling people or groups as good/bad, right/wrong, responsible/irresponsible, stupid/smart. ("The opposition is irresponsible.")
2. **Evaluations presented as facts** — subjective assessments stated as objective truths. ("This policy is a disaster.")
3. **Generalizations** — "always", "never", "everyone", "nobody", "all [group] are...". ("They never listen to ordinary citizens.")
4. **Accusations of motive** — attributing intent without evidence. ("They're doing this for votes, not for people.")
5. **Faux feelings** — interpretations disguised as feelings: "betrayed", "attacked", "ignored", "disrespected" by [group]. ("Citizens feel betrayed by this government.")
6. **Demands** — compliance expected, non-compliance met with blame or threat. ("They must reverse this policy immediately.")
7. **Denial of responsibility** — "have to", "must", "no choice", "they make us". ("We have no choice but to oppose this.")
8. **Dehumanizing language** — reducing people to labels, categories, or abstractions. ("These people", "those bureaucrats", "the elite".)
9. **Us-vs-them framing** — language that divides into opposing camps. ("Unlike our opponents, we stand with the people.")
10. **Comparisons** — measuring one group against another to establish superiority. ("While they wasted billions, we delivered results.")

#### Unexpressed Feelings and Needs

- **Feelings likely present** — what genuine feelings (from the Feelings Catalog) might the speaker be experiencing? These are often hidden behind the rhetoric.
- **Needs driving the statement** — what universal human needs (from the Needs Catalog) is the speaker trying to meet? Go beyond the surface position to the underlying motivation.

#### Hidden Observation

What concrete, verifiable observation might be underneath the evaluations? What would a camera have recorded?

#### Comparison Section (multi-citation only)

When multiple citations are provided, compare:
- Do different speakers use the same life-alienating patterns?
- Do they share underlying needs despite opposed positions?
- Are there patterns in how political discourse across the spectrum departs from NVC?

### Phase 3: NVC Transformation (on user request only)

Transform each citation into an NVC-structured statement. Rules:

1. **Preserve the political intent** — the transformed version must advocate for the same policy position. NVC changes how something is said, not what is being said.
2. **Preserve the speaker's voice** — adapt to the speaker's context and audience. Avoid robotic NVC templates.
3. **Four-component rewrite**:
   - **Observation**: What specific, verifiable situation is the speaker responding to?
   - **Feeling**: What genuine feeling (from the Feelings Catalog) might they be experiencing?
   - **Need**: What universal need (from the Needs Catalog) is driving their position?
   - **Request**: What concrete, positive, doable action are they proposing?
4. **Reflection section**: After all transformations, reflect on what changed — what patterns were removed, what became visible, and what remains the same in political intent.

## Neutrality Rules

1. **Analyze communication, not positions.** The tool evaluates how something is said, never whether the position itself is right or wrong. A policy you agree with can be expressed using life-alienating language; a policy you oppose can be expressed in NVC.
2. **Equal depth for all citations.** Apply the same analytical rigor to every citation regardless of political affiliation. Do not go deeper on one side than the other.
3. **No implied ranking.** Do not suggest that one citation is "worse" or "better" than another. Each citation stands on its own analysis.
4. **Steelman, don't strawman.** When identifying underlying needs, give each speaker the most charitable interpretation. Assume the speaker genuinely cares about the needs you identify.
5. **Acknowledge legitimate disagreement.** Different speakers may have genuinely different needs that are in tension. Name this honestly without resolving it artificially.

## Output Format

### Phase 1 + 2 (delivered together)

```
## Citation Analysis

### Citation 1
> "[exact quote]"
> — [source]

**Life-alienating patterns identified:**
- [Pattern name]: "[specific phrase from quote]" — [brief explanation of why this is life-alienating]
- ...

**Hidden observation:** [What a camera would have recorded — the verifiable facts underneath]

**Unexpressed feelings:** [Genuine feelings from the Feelings Catalog the speaker might be experiencing]

**Underlying needs:** [Universal needs from the Needs Catalog driving this statement]

### Citation 2
[Same structure]

### Comparison (if multiple citations)
[Cross-citation pattern analysis]
```

### Phase 3 (only when user requests)

```
## NVC Transformation

### Citation 1 — NVC Version
> "[Four-component NVC rewrite preserving political intent]"

**What changed:**
- [Pattern removed] → [What replaced it]
- ...

### Citation 2 — NVC Version
[Same structure]

### Reflection
[What patterns were shared, what became visible through transformation, what stays the same in political intent]
```

## Interactive Pause

After completing Phase 1 + Phase 2, **always stop and ask the user** before proceeding to Phase 3:

> "Would you like me to transform these citations into NVC-structured versions that preserve the same political intent? Or would you prefer to analyze additional citations first?"

Only proceed to Phase 3 when the user explicitly confirms.

## Welcome Intro

On first use in a conversation, begin with a brief 2-3 sentence welcome:
- Explain that this tool analyzes real political quotes through the NVC lens.
- Mention that the goal is to identify life-alienating communication patterns and surface the human needs behind political rhetoric — not to judge political positions.
- Then proceed with the analysis.

On subsequent uses, skip the intro and go straight to the analysis.
