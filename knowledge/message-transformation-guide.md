# Message Transformation Guide

## Purpose

Transform any message — email, chat, feedback, complaint — into one that follows NVC principles while preserving the sender's intent and voice.

## Two Modes

### One-Shot Transformation

Best for: messages where the observation, feelings, needs, and intent are already fairly clear.

1. Read the original message
2. Identify the implicit observation, feelings, needs, and request
3. Rewrite the message using the four NVC components
4. Present the transformed message alongside a brief "What changed" note explaining the key shifts

### Guided Clarification

Best for: messages where the situation is ambiguous, the feelings are unclear, or the user may want to refine what they actually want to say.

Walk through each NVC component one at a time, asking the user a single clarifying question per step:

1. **Observation**: "What specific event or behavior triggered this message?" — help the user separate observation from evaluation
2. **Feelings**: "When that happened, what did you feel?" — offer 2-3 candidate feelings from the catalog if the user is unsure
3. **Needs**: "What need of yours was affected?" — offer 2-3 candidate needs from the catalog if the user is unsure
4. **Request**: "What concrete action would you like to request?" — help the user formulate a positive, doable, negotiable request

After all four steps, assemble the final NVC message and present it with a summary of the transformation.

## Choosing a Mode

After receiving the message, always ask the user which mode they prefer:

> I can transform this in two ways:
> 1. **One-shot** — I'll rewrite it directly using NVC principles
> 2. **Guided** — I'll walk you through it step by step (observation → feelings → needs → request)
>
> Which do you prefer?

## Handling Already Well-Formed Messages

If the original message already follows NVC principles well:
- Acknowledge this explicitly
- Point out what's already working
- Offer minor refinements only if they genuinely improve clarity
- Do not force unnecessary changes

## Transformation Principles

- **Preserve intent**: The transformed message must convey the same core message. Never change what the person is trying to say — change how they say it.
- **Sound natural**: Avoid robotic NVC templates ("When I see X, I feel Y, because I need Z, would you be willing to..."). Adapt the NVC structure to fit the message's context and tone.
- **Suggest, don't prescribe**: Present the transformation as one possible way to say it, not the "correct" version. The user decides what feels authentic.
- **Strip evaluations gently**: Replace judgments and labels with concrete observations, but don't lose the emotional weight of the message.
- **Translate faux feelings**: If the original uses faux feelings (e.g., "I feel disrespected"), translate to genuine feelings (e.g., "I feel hurt") and explain the shift.
- **Name the need**: Make implicit needs explicit. Most messages have a clear need hiding beneath the surface — connection, respect, autonomy, etc.
- **Formulate actionable requests**: Vague wishes ("I want things to be better") become specific, positive requests ("Would you be willing to...").
