# NVC Worked Examples

Each example shows a raw message — as it might spontaneously arise — alongside its NVC analysis and a reframed expression. These are illustrative; there is no single correct NVC formulation.

## Example 1: Workplace — Missed deadline

**Raw message**
> "You never deliver on time. This is the third time I've had to chase you. It's completely unacceptable."

**Analysis**
- Observation hidden inside evaluation: "never deliver on time" (generalization), "completely unacceptable" (judgment)
- Feeling: frustration, anxiety, possibly helplessness — not expressed
- Need: reliability, predictability, collaboration
- Request: absent

**NVC reframe**
> "The last three deliverables were submitted after the agreed deadline — the most recent one by two days. I feel frustrated and anxious because I'm relying on this work to meet my own commitments, and I need us to be able to depend on each other. Would you be willing to let me know by end of day if you expect to miss a deadline, before it passes?"

## Example 2: Relationship — Feeling neglected

**Raw message**
> "You're always on your phone. You don't care about me at all."

**Analysis**
- Observation: "always on your phone" (generalization)
- Faux feeling: "you don't care" (interpretation of intent)
- Need: connection, attention, presence
- Request: absent

**NVC reframe**
> "When we're eating together and you're looking at your phone — it happened four times during dinner this week — I feel disconnected and a bit sad, because I really want us to be present with each other during that time. Would you be willing to put your phone face-down during dinner?"

## Example 3: Self-expression — Inner criticism

**Raw message (internal)**
> "I'm so stupid. I can't believe I made that mistake in front of everyone."

**Analysis**
- Observation: making a mistake in a meeting
- Feeling: embarrassment, fear
- Need: competence, belonging, respect from others
- This is self-directed — NVC can be applied inward

**NVC reframe (self-empathy)**
> "I said something inaccurate in the meeting and others noticed. I feel embarrassed and a little afraid, because I care about being seen as reliable and competent. What do I need right now? Perhaps some reassurance that one mistake doesn't define me, and a moment to think about how I might address it."

## Example 4: Parenting — Child not doing homework

**Raw message**
> "You're so lazy! You haven't touched your homework. You'll never pass if you keep this up."

**Analysis**
- Observation: homework not done
- Feeling: worry — not expressed
- Need: the child's wellbeing, learning, shared responsibility
- Request: absent

**NVC reframe**
> "I've noticed your homework hasn't been opened today, and yesterday it was the same. I feel worried because I care about you having the knowledge and skills you need, and I'm afraid falling behind will make things harder for you. Can we talk about what's getting in the way? I'd like to understand and figure out together what might help."

## Example 5: Political debate — On immigration policy

**Raw message (party A)**
> "The opposition's open-border fantasy is dangerous and naive. They're willing to sacrifice public safety for political points."

**Analysis**
- Evaluation disguised as fact: "open-border fantasy", "dangerous", "naive"
- Accusation of motive: "for political points"
- Feeling: fear, frustration — not expressed
- Need: safety, honest dialogue
- Request: absent

**NVC reframe**
> "When I look at the proposed policy, I don't see provisions addressing how a rapid increase in arrivals would be managed at border services and in housing. That concerns me — I'm worried about the capacity of communities to integrate newcomers quickly and about public safety. I need to feel confident that a realistic implementation plan is in place. Would the other party be willing to share specifically how they plan to address those capacity questions?"

## Example 6: Message transformation — Complaint to request

**Raw message**
> "This place is a mess. Nobody does anything around here."

**NVC reframe**
> "I see dishes in the sink and mail piled on the table that's been there since Tuesday. I feel overwhelmed when I walk in, because I need our shared space to feel calm and orderly. Would everyone be willing to spend 10 minutes this evening tidying their own area?"

## Notes on Using These Examples

- NVC expressions can feel long or formal at first. With practice, the same spirit can come through in far fewer words.
- The goal is not to use the formula verbatim. The goal is to move from evaluation and blame toward connection and clarity.
- It is entirely valid to express anger, frustration, or sadness in NVC — the difference is in *how*, not *whether*.
