# NVC Core Principles and Common Pitfalls

## Core Principles

### 1. All humans share the same needs
Universal human needs — for safety, belonging, autonomy, meaning, etc. — are shared by everyone. What differs between people are the *strategies* they use to meet those needs. Recognizing this shared humanity is the foundation of NVC empathy.

### 2. Feelings are messengers of needs
Feelings arise to signal whether needs are being met or unmet. They are not caused by others' behavior — they are caused by our own needs. Others may be the *stimulus*, but not the *cause*. This distinction preserves personal responsibility and prevents blame.

### 3. Every action is an attempt to meet a need
Even actions that seem harmful, selfish, or irrational are attempts — however misguided the strategy — to meet a real human need. Understanding the need behind behavior opens the door to compassion.

### 4. Connection before solution
NVC prioritizes empathic connection before problem-solving. When people feel genuinely heard, their capacity for openness, generosity, and flexibility increases. Rushing to solutions before connection often backfires.

### 5. Requests, not demands
Genuine requests grant the other person freedom to say no. The quality of the relationship is the goal; the specific request is a strategy. If "no" triggers punishment or guilt, the request was actually a demand.

### 6. Self-empathy first
Before empathizing with others, NVC encourages turning the same compassionate attention inward. Understanding your own observations, feelings, and needs allows you to communicate from a grounded, clear place rather than reactivity.

## The "Life-Alienating" Communication Patterns NVC Seeks to Replace

Rosenberg identified several widespread communication habits that obstruct compassion. These are called **life-alienating communication**.

### Moralistic judgment
Labeling people as good/bad, right/wrong, responsible/irresponsible based on behavior. This includes diagnosing, criticizing, and evaluating.

> "You're selfish." / "That was irresponsible." / "She's passive-aggressive."

NVC alternative: Describe behavior as an observation and express how it relates to your needs.

### Comparisons
Measuring oneself or others against a standard or against other people.

> "Why can't you be more like your sister?" / "Other teams deliver on time."

### Denial of responsibility
Using language that obscures the fact that we have choice — e.g., "have to", "must", "can't", "you make me feel".

> "I had to fire him." / "You make me so angry."

NVC alternative: "I chose to...", "I feel... because I need..."

### Demands
Communicating that compliance is required and non-compliance will be met with blame, guilt, or punishment — even when framed as a request.

### Thinking in terms of who deserves what
Operating from a belief that some people deserve to suffer for their actions (retributive thinking), rather than asking what they need and what would help.

## Common Pitfalls in Practice

### Feelings vs. faux feelings
Words like "manipulated", "ignored", "rejected", "abandoned", "betrayed" describe interpretations of others' behavior, not internal emotional states. They disguise judgment as feeling.

**Pitfall**: "I feel ignored." (interpretation of the other's intent)
**NVC**: "I feel sad and lonely." (genuine feeling)

### Observations vs. evaluations
Even subtle language can contain evaluation. Words like "often", "rarely", "always", "never", "too much" carry judgment.

**Pitfall**: "You're often late."
**NVC**: "In the last three weeks, you arrived after the agreed time on four occasions."

### Needs vs. strategies
Expressing a strategy as if it were a need makes it sound like the other person is *required* to fulfill it.

**Pitfall**: "I need you to listen to me."
**NVC**: "I need to feel heard. Would you be willing to listen to me for a few minutes?"

### Empathy vs. advice
When someone shares something difficult, the impulse is often to reassure, advise, or explain. NVC calls for staying with the feeling and need of the other person first.

**Pitfall**: "At least you still have a job." / "Here's what you should do..."
**NVC**: "It sounds like you're feeling really exhausted and need some relief. Is that right?"

### Empathy vs. sympathy
Sympathy is feeling *for* someone (often with pity); empathy is feeling *with* someone — being present to their experience without judgment or emotional distance.

### The "NVC-ish" trap
Using NVC vocabulary without the underlying intention of connection becomes mechanical and can feel manipulative or condescending. The spirit of NVC matters more than the exact formula.

## NVC and Anger

Rosenberg gave particular attention to anger. In NVC, anger is not suppressed — it is used as a signal. Anger tells you that a judgment is present ("He *should* have done X"). The practice is to:

1. Pause and notice the anger.
2. Identify the judgment underneath ("I think this is unfair / wrong").
3. Translate the judgment into the unmet need ("I need fairness / respect / honesty").
4. Express the feeling and need: "I feel furious because I deeply need honesty in our relationship."

Anger is valid; the violent expression of it (blaming, attacking) is what NVC offers an alternative to.
